# 30-days-java UPDATE: FAILED.

### DayOne Learnings
- Learned about classes, objects and constructors
- Created a random number generator (but tbh, I didn't really understand what is going on while creating it)

I challenged myself to learn java for 30 days! starting from **10/10/2022 - 11/09/2022**
